** NOTE: RECENT VISIBLE CHANGES

- =symon-initialize= is now obsolete (use =symon-mode= instead)
- =symon-fetcher= is now obsolete (use =symon-monitors= instead)

** Usage

Load either `symon-linux' or `symon-windows'

: (require 'symon-linux)

and turn on `symon-mode'.

: (symon-mode)

then a tiny system monitor is displayed in minibuffer, during idle.

** Customization

- =symon-monitors= :: List of symon monitors used to fetch system
     statuses. You can set this variable to specify what metrics to
     display and what to not. List of available monitors is provided
     below.

- =symon-refresh-rate= :: Refresh rate of symon display.

- =symon-delay= :: Delay in seconds until symon is displayed.

You need to setup all these 3 variables before activating
=symon-mode=.

- =symon-sparkline-size= :: =(WIDTH . HEIGHT)= of sparkline.
