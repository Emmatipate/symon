- =symon-initialize= is now obsolete (use =symon-mode= instead)
- =symon-fetcher= is now obsolete (use =symon-monitors= instead)

** Usage

Load =symon=

: (require 'symon)

and turn on =symon-mode=.

then a tiny system monitor is displayed in minibuffer, during idle.

** Customization

     statuses. You can set this variable to specify what metrics to
     display and what to not. List of available monitors is provided
     below.

- =symon-refresh-rate= :: Refresh rate of symon display.

- =symon-delay= :: Delay in seconds until symon is displayed.

- =symon-history-size= :: Number of old values to keep. Sparklines
     grow faster when set smaller.

You need to setup all these 4 variables before activating
=symon-mode=.
